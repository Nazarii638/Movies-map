# Movies-map
The program creates the map using the folium library. 
For creating the map you need to have the two files: locations.list and main.py.location.list is a file in which we have the films' title, the year of coming out
and places where movies were filmed. The second one contains the code. Program reads the file, works with it's data, then finds more acuracy and the coordinates of
the place. After that program calculates the distances and creates the map. The user get the map.html file. There are 20 marks. 10 of them nave blue colour and they
mean the closest film to your inputed location. Other 10 marks is red and they mean the farest films to your inputed location. About execution: the execution lates
from 0 second to 3 minutes. The example of the executing my program: open the terminal and print the next: [path-to-python] [path-to-the-program] [year] [latitude]
[longtitude] [path-to-file-with-films-info]. For example: python3 /Users/igor/Desktop/vscode_intro.py/semester2/Labs/Laba1/main.py 2015 42 30 /Users/igor/Desktop/vscode_intro.py/locations.list :
